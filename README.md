### Description

Bootstrapped with **CRA** and using Tailwindcss. I built a simple Task manager, it's incomplete and may have some bugs. I didn't have the intention to finish it at all but to try for the first time  **Tailwindcss**.

I have to say, I really love working with that so called "*Utility CSS Framework*". In fact, I built the UI pretty fast.

### Features (so far)
 - Register User
 - Login User
 - Tasks CRUD
 - Assign task to a registered user
 - Mark tasks as done
 - Add comments to any task
 - Edit/delete comments to any task (owner only)
 - Like comments
 - List Team  members


### Notes
This "project" is using Context Api and it's only hooks based components.

### Backend
This is using a simple ExpressJS backend built by me called Ninja (WIP), details [here](https://github.com/AlexSegen/ninja.api)
