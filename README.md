### Description

Bootstrapped with **CRA** and using Tailwindcss. I built a simple Task manager, it's incomplete and may have some bugs. I didn't have the intention to finish it at all but to try for the first time  **Tailwindcss**.

I have to say, I really love working with that so called "*Utility CSS Framework*". In fact, I built the UI pretty fast.
